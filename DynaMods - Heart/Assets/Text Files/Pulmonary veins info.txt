The pulmonary veins are phylogenetically recent structures that form independently, rather than taking over portions of the older cardinal vein systems. From each lung, venous drainage channels converge until they ultimately form a single large common pulmonary vein, which empties into the left atrium of the heart. As the atrium expands, the common pulmonary vein becomes incorporated into its wall Ultimately, the absorption passes the first and second branch points of the original pulmonary veins, with resulting entrance of four independent pulmonary veins into the left atrium.
