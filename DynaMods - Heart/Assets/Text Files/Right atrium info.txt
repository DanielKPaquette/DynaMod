The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the superior vena cava (SVC), the inferior vena cava (IVC), the coronary sinus (covered by the thebesian valve), and the thebesian veins.
It is grossly the shape of an irregular ellipsoid, with the exception of the right atrial appendage, which arises anteriorly. The right atrial appendage overlies the aortic root and the proximal right coronary artery (RCA).
The right atrium is separated from the left atrium by the interatrial septum. In cases of congenital cardiac malformations, the morphologic right atrium can be identified by the fossa ovalis in the interatrial septum.
The right atrium leads into the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve. 
One of the main anatomic landmarks of the right atrium, the crista terminalis is a muscular ridge on the anterior aspect of the chamber. The atrium is lined by pectinate muscles to the left of this crest, and these extend into the right atrial appendage. The atrial lead of an external pacemaker is frequently located in these muscles. To the right of the crista terminalis, the atrial lining is smooth and this represents the right horn of the sinus venosus.
