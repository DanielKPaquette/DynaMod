The right ventricle (RV) remains the cardiac chamber for which scientific data regarding structure, function, adaptation to load, or arrhythmogenic potential is still behind what we know for the left ventricle, despite more recent efforts in this field. RV function is critical in numerous pathologies, related to pressure overload (like pulmonary hypertension but also arterial hypertension), volume overload (left-to-right shunts, tricuspid regurgitation), and myocardial diseases (which can be global, left ventricular, or right ventricular, more specific cardiomyopathies) as well as right ventricular ischemia or infarction. Moreover, the adaptation of the RV to more extreme physiologic situations (e.g., hypoxia at high altitude, high-level exercise) opens windows for understanding its physiology.

Despite data on the prognostic value of RV function, there is still debate on the best parameters that describe it and their clinical relevance. Important developments in right ventricular imaging have occurred during the last years, from myocardial deformation imaging to 3D-echocardiography and from cardiac MRI to right ventriculoarterial coupling studies, which have all contributed to a better understanding of right ventricular pathophysiology.
