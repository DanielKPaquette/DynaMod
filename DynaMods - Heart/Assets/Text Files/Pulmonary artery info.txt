The pulmonary artery is a blood vessel which delivers deoxygenated blood to the lungs. Like all arteries, the pulmonary artery pumps blood away from the heart—in contrast to veins, which deliver blood to the heart. However, unlike most arteries, which carry blood with a relatively high oxygen content, the pulmonary artery transports blood whose oxygen content is relatively low.

The pulmonary artery begins in the heart at the base of the right ventricle. At this point, it is known as the pulmonary trunk, which is relatively short and wide. As it leaves the heart, the pulmonary trunk branches off in two directions –the left and right pulmonary artery. The left and right branches bring their de-oxygenated blood to the corresponding left and right lungs. There, the blood is enriched with oxygen and pumped back into our heart via the pulmonary veins. This freshly oxygenated blood flows into our heart's left atrium, is pumped to the left ventricle, and then finally dispersed through the aorta to the arteries which carry the oxygen-rich blood throughout our body. 

The pulmonary artery is one of the few arteries which transports oxygen-low blood and the pulmonary veins are among the few veins which deliver oxygen-rich blood.
